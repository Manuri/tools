<h1>Creating a Top Down Web Service Using WSAS WTP Tools</h1>
<li>If we have a Web service definition in the form of WSDL, we can create a service from that WSDL</li>
<li>Import the <a href="source/AreaService.wsdl">AreaService.wsdl</a> to the created MyDynamicProject</li>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<li>We will now invoke the Web service creation wizard with respect to the newly imported WSDL. Select the AreaService.wsdl source, then select File -> New -> Other... -> Web Services -> Web Service</li>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<li>
Because the wizard was invoked related to a correct WSDL, the correct Web services scenario will be picked automatically with the correct service definition. Make sure that you have moved the scale to Start service. Select the Web service runtime hyperlink and then select the WSAS Web service runtime. Click
<strong>OK</strong>
.

<strong>Finsh</strong>
to generate the service.
