		<h1> How to refer to a Named Endpoint </h1>
			<p>
			In this section of the document we explain how you can refer to a
			Named Endpoint from a mediation flow.

		<h2 id="method1">Drag and Drop from the Defined Endpoint list in tool palette</h2>
		<p>
			An endpoint which has a defined name referred as
			named endpoint. You
			can follow
			<a href="esb_category.html#EndpointArtifact">this</a>
			guide to learn how to create a
			endpoint. In Developer Studio ESB
			graphical editor all the named
			endpoints you have created within the
			same project are listed under
			the defined endpoint palette category as
			shown in the below image.


		</p>

		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			To use them you just need to drag and drop them any
			supported
			configuration you want to use them for an example sequence
			,proxy
			config ext..
		</p>

		<h2 id="method2">Refer a defined endpoint another project in the workspace.</h2>

		<p>In most of the cases we want to reuse a named endpoint which
			resides in another ESB configuration project other than using the
			endpoints defined in the same project.In that case you can use below
			mechanism to reuse those in any supported configuration.
			Here we are creating another ESB configuration project named as
			EsbConfig.
			And add endpoint named as "external_ ep" as shown in the below image. </p>

		<p>
			<img src="images/esb_graphical/ep3.png" alt="Named_ep" />
		</p>

		<p> Drag drop a new named endpoint from the Tool Palette. Open up the
			properties editor for the newly added endpoint by right clicking on
			it and selecting "show properties view" option.
			Select "Refering Endpoint Type" as Static and click on the button in the
			"Static Reference Key" field.</p>

		<p>
			<img src="images/esb_graphical/ep4.png" alt="Named_ep" />
		</p>

		<p>
			It will pop up the "Resource Key Editor" as show in the below image.
			Select "workspace" option from there.
         </p>

		<p>
			<img src="images/esb_graphical/ep5.png" alt="Named_ep" />
		</p>

		<p>
			The resulting dialog will list and show the existing endpoints in the
			workspace. You can select one of them and refer it as the named
			endpoint in your configuration.
         </p>

		</p>

		<h2 id="method3">Refer endpoint in the registry resource project</h2>

		<p>
			In another scenario you may want to deploy your endpoint as a registry
			resource to registry and refer that endpoint within the
			configuration. WSO2 Developer Studio has a project type referred as
			"Registry Resource Project" these projects can contain various kind
			of registry resources and can be used as a artifact Carbon
			Application Archive.

			You can follow this guide to create Registry resource Project.

			Then open the Developer Studio Dashboard Click on the Endpoint link in
			the Enterprise Service Bus category. It will pop up "Create New
			Endpoint" wizard select "Create A New Endpoint" option.

			The next wizard page will look like below to save the endpoint in a
			registry resource project check the "Make this as Dynamic Endpoint"
			and click on the "Browse.." button relevant to "Save endpoint in"
			field. The project browser dialog will list the Registry Resource
			Projects in the workspace.
