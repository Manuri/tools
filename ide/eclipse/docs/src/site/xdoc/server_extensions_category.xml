		<h2 id="CustomMediator">Mediator Project</h2>
		<p>
        To create a <strong>Mediator Project</strong>, open <strong>WSO2 Developer Studio Dashboard</strong> 
        and select <strong>Mediator Project</strong> from <strong>Enterprise Service Bus</strong> category.
        </p>
		<p>

		<p>
		There are two ways to create an ESB Mediator Project.    
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create New Mediator</li>
			<li>Import From Workspace</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<br></br>
			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/mediator2.png"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>

		<p>If you select <strong>Create New Mediator</strong> option, you can create a new <strong>Mediator 
		Project</strong> from the scratch. Give necessary information as <strong>Project Name, Package Name 
		</strong> and <strong>Class Name</strong>. Then click <strong>Finish</strong>.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<br></br>
			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/mediator3.png"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		Once you click <strong>Finish</strong>, you will see a new project has been created in the workspace and 
		it has a mediator class which is  extending <strong>org.apache.synapse.mediators.AbstractMediator</strong> 
		class.
		</p>

		<p>
			<br></br>
			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/mediator4.png"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>	
		<p>
		In that class, you can implement your custom mediator according to your requirement. 
		</p>

		<p>
		If you select <strong>Import From Workspace</strong> option, it will list all the projects 
		which include source files that are being extended by 
		<strong>org.apache.synapse.mediators.AbstractMediator</strong>.
		</p>	
		
		<p>
			<br></br>
			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/mediator5.png"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>	
			
		<p>
		Specify other information if necessary and click <strong>Finish</strong>. Now you will see that the project 
		you select the mediator class has become a <strong>Mediator Project</strong>.
		</p>	
		<p>
		Once you click <strong>Finish</strong>, you will see that the selected project also added with the 
		project nature of <strong>org.wso2.developerstudio.eclipse.artifact.mediator.project.nature</strong> and 
		you will see a new icon has been added to the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			<br></br>
			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/mediator6.png"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		As you did for all the other projects, you can export the created <strong>Mediator 
		Project</strong> in to a deployable artifact by right click on the project and select
		 <strong>Export Project as Deployable Archive</strong>. With this it will create you a 
		 <strong>jar</strong> file, which is a bundle that you can deploy in to any 
		 <strong>WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus</strong>. At the same time, 
		 you can group it with a <strong>Carbon Application Project</strong> and create the 
		 <strong>Carbon Application Archive [CAR]</strong> and deploy in to the <strong>WSO2 Enterprise 
		 Service Bus</strong>. 
		</p>
			
		<h2 id="DSValidator">Data Services Validator Project</h2>
		<p>
        To create a <strong>Data Services Validator Project</strong>, open <strong>WSO2 Developer Studio Dashboard</strong> 
        and select <strong>Data Services Validator Project</strong> from 
        <strong>Data Services</strong> category.  
        </p>
		<p>
			<br></br>
			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/dsv1.PNG"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>
		<p>
		There are two ways to create an Data Services Validator Project.    
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create New Data Service Validator Project</li>
			<li>Import Project From Workspace</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			<br></br>
			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/dsv2.PNG"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>

		<p>If you select <strong>Create New Data Service Validator Project</strong> option, you can create a 
		new <strong>Data Service Validator Project</strong> from the scratch. Give necessary information as <strong>Project Name, Package Name 
		</strong> and <strong>Class Name</strong>. Then click <strong>Finish</strong>.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<br></br>
			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/dsv3.PNG"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		Once you click <strong>Finish</strong>, you will see a new project has been created in the workspace and 
		it has a data services class which is implementing <strong>org.wso2.carbon.dataservices.core.validation.Validator</strong> 
		class.
		</p>

		<p>
			<br></br>
			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/dsv4.PNG"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>	
		<p>
		In that class, you can implement your data services validator logic according to your requirement. 
		</p>

		<p>
		If you select <strong>Import Project From Workspace</strong> option, it will list all the projects 
		which include source files that are being implemented by 
		<strong>org.wso2.carbon.dataservices.core.validation.Validator</strong>.
		</p>	
		
		<p>
			<br></br>
			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/dsv5.PNG"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>	
			
		<p>
		Specify other information if necessary and click <strong>Finish</strong>. Now you will see that the project 
		you select the data services validator class has become a <strong>Data Services Validator Project</strong>.
		</p>	
		<p>
		Once you click <strong>Finish</strong>, you will see that the selected project also added with the 
		project nature of <strong>org.wso2.developerstudio.eclipse.artifact.ds.validator.project.nature</strong> and 
		you will see a new icon has been added to the project.
		</p>
		<p>

			<img alt="New Server Runtime" src="images/dsv6.PNG"></img>
			<br></br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		As you did for all the other projects, you can export the created <strong>Data Services Validator 
		Project</strong> in to a deployable artifact by right click on the project and select
		 <strong>Export Project as Deployable Archive</strong>. With this it will create you a 
		 <strong>jar</strong> file, which is a bundle that you can deploy in to any 
		 <strong>WSO2 Data Services Server</strong>. At the same time, 
		 you can group it with a <strong>Carbon Application Project</strong> and create the 
		 <strong>Carbon Application Archive [CAR]</strong> and deploy in to the <strong>WSO2 Data Services 
		 Server</strong>.
