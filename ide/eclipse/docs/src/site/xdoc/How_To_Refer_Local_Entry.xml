		<h1>How To Refer a Local-Entry in ESB Graphical Editor</h1>
		<p>
			A Local-Entry in WSO2 ESB Configuration can be considered as a memory
			registry with a Key-Value pair, where the value could be either a
			Text String, XML String or a URL. Local-Entries are also can be
			referred from mediators in ESB mediation flows and they are being
			resolved in the runtime. Therefore Local-entries are used to store
			static content so often in ESB such as XSLT files, WSDL files, URLs,
			etc.
</p>
		<p>
			In this section we are going to explain how to refer to an Local-Entry
			which contains a XSLT (TransformXSLT) from XSLT mediator in a
			mediator flow.
</p>
		<p>
			First you need to add the XSLT mediator to your mediation flow. Therefore
			you need to click on the XSLT mediator on the Tool Palette and then
			click on the Canvas area of the ESB Editor. 
</p>
		<p>
			Once you add the XSLT mediator in the above manner, you will be able to
			see the XSLT Static Schema Key property in the Eclipse Properties
			view which accepts our XSLT Reference.

			Local-Entries in workspace categorized by ESB Configuration Project
			as shown below.

		</p>
		<p>Once you select the correct Local-Entry from the list of
			Local-Entries, you can click on Ok button and it will populate the
			correct Local-Entry name as the value for the XSLT Static Schema Key
			property in Eclipse Properties view as indicated in the image below.
