		<p>With the <strong>New Business Rule Service</strong> option, you will get an empty rule service according to 
		the information that you have provided. At the same time, you can upload a 
		<strong>Rule Service Conffiguration</strong> file with the extension of <strong>.rsl</strong> from the 
		file system.
		</p>

		If you select <strong>New Business Rule Service</strong> option, and click <strong>Next</strong>, wizard page 
		will ask you general information like <strong>Project Name</strong>, <strong>Rule Service Name</strong> 
		etc. Give necessary information and click <strong>Next</strong>.

		 You can export your rule service  project as a <strong>Carbon Application Project</strong> and create the 
		 <strong>Carbon Application Archive [CAR]</strong> and deploy in to the <strong>Carbon 
		 Server</strong>. When grouping your project as a <strong>Carbon Application Archive [CAR]</strong>, it will create you a 
		 <strong>aar</strong> file, which you can deploy in to any 
		 <strong>WSO2 Business Rules Services Server</strong>.
