		<h2 id="1">Default EndPoint</h2>
		<p>
			According to synapse definition of the Default Endpoint is an
			endpoint defined
			for adding QoS and other configurations to the
			endpoint which is
			resolved from the 'To' address of the message
			context. Graphical
			representation of the usage of Default Endpoint
			shown as below.

			And the configuration in xml shown below.

		</p>

		<p>
			Default endpoint will appear in the configuration as shown above.

		<h2 id="2">Addressing Endpoint</h2>

		<p>
			Addressing Endpoint is a WSO2 Developer Studio specific graphical
			representation to address special behavior of the ESB. Consider the
			below shown configuration segment.

		</p>

		<p>
			As shown in above image position 1 the send mediator suppose send
			message to some end point but where is the endpoint?. But ESB know
			how to handle this configuration is treats this configuration at the
			point 1 as if there was a Default Endpoint. And on the 2 point it
			just return back the message to client.

			But since we do not have
			proper endpoint configuration at point 1 we can
			not have a graphical
			representation for the endpoint in the editor.
			As an answer for above
			question WSO2 Developer Studio introduced the
			“Addressing Endpoint”
			which is only a graphical representation which
			handles a specific
			scenario. The Graphical representation of above
			configuration shown
			below.
