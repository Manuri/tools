    <h1>WSO2 Developer Studio Source Repository</h1>
    WSO2 Developer Studio is a set of plugins developed to run with popular Eclipse IDE.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project uses <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
        to manage its source code. Instructions on Subversion use can be found at
        <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/</a>.</p>

    <h2>Source code of the WSO2 Developer Studio 3.0.0 release</h2>
    <p>The following is a link to the online source tag of the WSO2 Developer Studio release.</p>

    <p><a href="https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/tags/tools/ide/eclipse/developer-studio/3.0.0/">
        https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/tags/tools/ide/eclipse/developer-studio/3.0.0/</a></p>

    <p>The complete source of Developer Studio can be checked out anonymously from
        SVN with this command:</p>
    <div class="source">
        <pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/tags/tools/ide/eclipse/developer-studio/3.0.0/ developerStudio</pre>
    </div>

    <p>The list of commands that can be run are as follows.<br/></p>

    <table border="1">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>mvn clean install</strong></td>
                <td>To create the complete release artifacts of WSO2 Developer Studio including the
                    binary distribution.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true</strong></td>

                <td>To create the complete release artifacts of WSO2 Developer Studio including the binary 
                , without running any of the unit tests, in offline mode. This
                    can be done only if you've already built the source at least once in the same day.</td>

    <h2>Source code of the WSO2 Developer Studio trunk</h2>
        <p>Everyone can access the Subversion repository via HTTPS, but Committers must checkout
            the Subversion repository via HTTPS.
        </p>

        <div class="source">
            <pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/tools/ide/eclipse/ developerStudioTrunk</pre>
        </div>

        <div class="source">
            <pre>$ mvn clean install</pre>
        </div>

        <p>To commit changes to the repository, execute the following command (svn will prompt
            you for your password)
        </p>
        <div class="source">
            <pre>$ svn commit --username your-username -m "A message"</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Access from behind a firewall</h2>
        <p>For those users who are stuck behind a corporate firewall which is blocking http access
            to the Subversion repository, you can try to access it via the developer connection:
        </p>
        <div class="source">
            <pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/tools/ide/eclipse/ developerStudioTrunk</pre>
        </div>
        <h2>Access through a proxy</h2>
        <p>The Subversion client can go through a proxy, if you configure it to do so.
            First, edit your "servers" configuration file to indicate which proxy to use. The
            files location depends on your operating system. On Linux or Unix it is
            located in the directory "~/.subversion". On Windows it is in "%APPDATA%\Subversion".
            (Try "echo %APPDATA%", note this is a hidden directory.)
        </p>
        <p>There are comments in the file explaining what to do. If you don't have that file, get
            the latest Subversion client and run any command; this will cause the configuration
            directory and template files to be created.
        </p>
        <p>Example : Edit the 'servers' file and add something like :</p>
        <div class="source">
            <pre>[global]
http-proxy-host = your.proxy.name
http-proxy-port = 3128
            </pre>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
